# Web Scraping and Spotify Track Search

This project involves web scraping tracklists from the website "https://sharing-db.club/category/minimal/" and searching for the extracted track names on Spotify. The goal is to document the tracks found, locate the tracks in spotify, and then add it to a playlist.

## Introduction

The Web Scraping and Spotify Track Search project aims to automate the process of documenting and checking the availability of tracks from a specific website on the Spotify platform. By leveraging web scraping techniques and the Spotify API, this project simplifies the task of manually searching for tracks and provides insights into their presence on Spotify.

## Project Overview

The project consists of several steps:

1. Web Scraping: The code uses the requests library and BeautifulSoup to scrape tracklists from the target website, specifically the "minimal" category.
2. Data Processing: The extracted track data is cleaned, organized, and stored for further analysis.
3. Spotify Track Search: The code utilizes the spotipy library to search for each track extracted from the website on Spotify.
4. Documentation: The project documents the tracks found on the website and their availability on Spotify.

## What I Did

1. I implemented web scraping techniques to extract tracklists from the target website, focusing on the "minimal" category.
2. I processed the extracted data, removing unnecessary information, and stored it for further analysis.
3. I utilized the Spotify API and the spotipy library to search for each track extracted from the website on Spotify.
4. I documented the tracks found on the website and indicated whether they were available on Spotify.

## Tools Used

The following tools and libraries were used in this project:

- Python
- Requests: Used to send HTTP requests and retrieve web page content.
- BeautifulSoup: Used for HTML parsing and web scraping.
- Pandas: Used for data manipulation and organization.
- spotipy: A lightweight Python library for the Spotify Web API integration.

## What I Learned

During the development of this project, I gained the following insights and knowledge:

- Web scraping techniques for extracting specific information from websites.
- Working with APIs, specifically integrating the Spotify API into a Python application.
- Data processing and manipulation using pandas to clean and structure extracted data.
- Improved proficiency in using Python libraries for web scraping, data analysis, and API interactions.

## Conclusion

The Web Scraping and Spotify Track Search project successfully demonstrates the automation of documenting tracks from a website and checking their availability on Spotify. It streamlines the process by eliminating the need for manual search, providing valuable insights into the presence of tracks on the Spotify platform.

In the future, I plan to further enhance this project by incorporating additional features such as generating reports or recommendations based on the extracted track data. This project serves as a valuable learning experience and provides a foundation for similar automation tasks involving web scraping and API integration.

Special thanks to the creators of the Requests, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and spotipy libraries, which greatly facilitated the development process.
